- Support binary arrays
  - It would be nice to support c-style indeterminate length arrays where the length is determined at run time based on the underlying ArrayBuffer
- Length check/validation
  - Constructing a BinaryStruct does not check the underlying buffer size to ensure that it is large enough
    - This is mainly for speed and flexibility; there could be legitimate use cases where examining a partial struct could be useful
  - It would be nice to have a convenience length check function to ensure that reading all struct members is possible
  - There could also be a strict check when the buffer size should exactly match the struct size
